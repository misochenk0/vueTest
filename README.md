# Vue Todo task

Todo app was created using ***VueJs*** as a JavaScript framework. The functionality of the app is to *create* / *edit* / *remove* / *sort* / *filter* and *check* tasks as completed. 
To add a new task you should input **at least 2 symbols** in the displayed form on the app page (button will appear).
Added tasks could be ***removed***, ***checked as completed***, ***edited***, or ***moved to another position***. 
When there are either completed and active tasks you can use ***filter buttons*** (All, Active, Completed) to look through specific tasks.
"***Check all***" button marks all tasks as completed.
"***Clear completed***" button removes completed tasks from the list.

Information blocks display statistics about all your tasks. 

If tasks list is empty, footer appears with phrase *"Congrats, you have no more tasks to do"*.

Tasks are stored in the browser SessionStorage and won't disappear after page reloading* 
**but would be missed after closing your browser*
